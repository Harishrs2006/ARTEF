  {
    question: "What makes ARTEF different from standard LLM test libraries?",
    answer:
      "Traditional LLM tests only evaluate static single-turn Q&A pairs. ARTEF is built for autonomous agents — it probes multi-turn conversation trajectories, tool execution sequences, memory retrieval vulnerabilities, and chained adversarial payloads in real-time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the CI/CD Safety Gate work?",
    answer:
      "ARTEF integrates directly into GitHub Actions or GitLab pipelines. When code or prompts change, ARTEF runs a seeded adversarial regression matrix. If attack success rate exceeds your threshold, the build automatically fails and blocks deployment.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does ARTEF work with self-hosted or custom LLM agents?",
    answer:
      "Yes. ARTEF supports OpenAI/Anthropic/HuggingFace APIs, custom REST endpoints, MCP (Model Context Protocol) agents, and LangChain/CrewAI/AutoGen architectures.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can ARTEF run on-premise without exposing private models?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. ARTEF is fully containerized via Docker and can be hosted locally, in air-gapped VPCs, or within Kubernetes clusters using PostgreSQL, Redis, and local ChromaDB instances.",
